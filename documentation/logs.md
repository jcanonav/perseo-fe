# Logs

Logs have levels `FATAL`, `ERROR`, `INFO` and `DEBUG`. The log level must be set in the configuration file `config.js`

```javascript
/**
 * Default log level. Can be one of: 'DEBUG', 'INFO', 'WARN', 'ERROR', 'FATAL'
 * @type {string}
 */
config.logLevel = 'INFO';
```

 In order to have logs that can enable alarms being raised and ceased, `INFO` level should be set in the configuration file.
With `ERROR` level, alarms could be raised but not ceased.

Each log line contains several fields of the form *name*`=` *value*, separated by `|`
* `time` time of the log
* `lvl` log level
* `corr` correlator from the incoming request that caused the current transaction. It allows trace a global operation through several systems. If not present as field header in the incoming request, the internal transaction id will be used.
* `trans` internal transaction id
* `op`  description of the operation being done. Generally, the path of the URL invoked.
* `msg` message

```
time=2014-12-16T12:01:46.487Z | lvl=ERROR | corr=62d2f662-37de-4dcf-ba02-013642501a2d | trans=62d2f662-37de-4dcf-ba02-013642501a2d | op=/actions/do | msg=emailAction.SendMail connect ECONNREFUSED
```

Logs for errors can show additional info in the message, giving a hint of the root cause of the problem (`ECONNREFUSED`,`ENOTFOUND`, `ECONNRESET`, ...)

# Alarms

Alarm levels

* **Critical** - The system is not working
* **Major** - The system has a problem that degrades the service and must be addressed
* **Warning** - It is happening something that must be notified

Alarms will be inferred from logs typically. For each alarm, a 'detection strategy' and a 'stop condition' is provided (note that the stop condition is not shown in the next table, but it is included in the detailed description for each alarm below). The conditions are use for detecting logs that should raise the alarm and cease it respectively. Level (`lvl`), operation  (`op`) and message (`msg`) are considerated to evaluate the condition. The message in a condition is considerated to be a prefix of the possible message in the log. Starting spaces in each field is recommended to be eliminated to avoid missing a log that should meet the condition in other case. The expressions `h:p` and `h:p/d` are used as placeholders for any combination on a host, a port and a database (usually the actual values will be taken from config file)

Some errors avoid perseo to start up. They have `FATAL` level and are caused by
* There is no connection to database
* There is no connection to perseo-core

They should be solved in order to get perseo running. Once it is got started, such errors will cause a log that should generate an alarm.
